PerProxy will be a simple HTTP proxy that uses Perspectives [1] to
monitor SSL connections, detect and thwart SSL attempts using
fradulent certificates (e.g. [3,4]). It is not in any way intended to
replace the Perspectives Firefox extension [2], but to serve in
instances when the extension cannot be used (e.g. you are using
another browser, a version of Firefox that doesn't support the
extension).

Currently PerProxy is a work in progress. At this time it parses the
SSL handshake and extracts the server certificate, but does no more
than that. Adding the check to Perspectives using the python
Perspective-Server code [5] is next. Figuring out the right way to
reject the connection and get a useful message to the broser and user
is a challenge to be tackled.

This code is freely distributed under an MIT license [6]. This code is
based on and includes the python-proxy code [7], which is also
distributed under the MIT license. The Perspectives-Server code is
distributed under a GPLv3 license [8].

Note that the Perspective-Server code is included as a git submodule. After cloning the git repo, use the following commands to pull in the Perspectives-Server code:

% git submodule init
% git submodule update
